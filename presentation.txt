A focus of this thesis was to study the relatively underused numerical
differentiation technique called Complex Taylor Series Expansion or CTSE.  A
research objective was to verify experimentally whether CTSE could be used to
compute tangent-stiffness matrices or Jacobians for use in Newton's method for
solving nonlinear systems.

CTSE was interesting for this application because prior literature showed it
to be simple to implement, robust and highly accurate for taking derivitives of
1D functions. Because Jacobian accuracy is critical for ensuring fast
convergence of Newton's method, it was seen as worthwhile to look at CTSE for
this application.  

Another objective was to then evaluate CTSE as an alternative to other methods
for computing Jacobians including Automatic Differentiation or AD, and Finite
Difference. AD is essentially a computer implementation of the chain rule.  The
basis of comparison would be Jacobian accuracy, end solution accuracy,
iteration speed, efficiency and convergence rate.  

A last objective was to compare the methods within a production scale,
massively-parallel code under varying conditions.  The computational
peridynamics code, Peridigm, developed at Sandia National Labs was chosen as a
testbed because it already included implementations of AD and
finite-difference.  The purpose of this was to evaluate the scalability of each
of the methods under conditions of varying problem size and varying level of
parallelization.
